# Learning to play: Super Mario Bros



## 1. Install necessary packages

```{bash}
pip install -r requirement.txt
```


## 3. Re-Run NEAT

If you only want to beat the world 1 level 1, please go to the `\NEAT` folder and run:

```{bash}
python NEAT.py
```

If you want to get the result of Section 5.5 of our report, please go the `\NEAT\ExpA`, `\NEAT\ExpB`, `\NEAT\ExpC`, `\NEAT\ExpD`, `\NEAT\ExpE` step by step, and run:

```{bash}
sh run.sh
```

in each directory. 

Then, open the `\NEAT\ResultAnalysis.ipynb`, run each code cell in this file, and you can get the result as we did. However, because we didn't fix the random seed. Therefore the plots may not be exactly the same as ours.
